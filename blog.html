        <h2>Teachable Machines</h2>
        <p>Mary Rickman / July 19th, 2022</p>

            On our second day of class me and a partner made a teachable machine. A teachable machine is a web tool in which you can create a machine learning model really easily and people can access it. For my teachable machine we trained the machine to be able to recognize the difference between a monarch butterfly, a sonoran blue butterfly, and a purple hairstreak butterfly. We did this by inputting data from each species into the model. The way the machine works is that a user would be able to upload a picture of one of the three butterflies and the machine would show the user what species the butterfly is. The machine does this by giving a percentage of accuracy in which it detects each species. For example if a user were to upload a picture of the monarch butterfly the machine should predict with 100% accuracy that it is a monarch butterfly. Something that I learned is that with machine learning an abundance of data is ideal because it reduces the margin of error. So in the future I would definitely add more data and more variations, such as species, into the model.

            The IT Girls Summer Program is held in the School of Information Studies here at Syracuse University. So far the experience has been amazing and I'm learning something new every day. This video is very helpful on getting more information about the iSchool and what it provides for its students. <br>
