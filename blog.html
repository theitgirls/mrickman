        <h2>Women in Intelligence</h2>
        <p>Mary Rickman / July 19th, 2022</p>

        <p> 
            Maureen Baginski is a very important women in the histiory of our government's intelligence. Baginski first worked at the NSA in 1979 and then moved on to work at the FBI in 2003. After she retired from the FBI she worked in a couple of companies in the private sector such as BearingPoint Inc. and Argon ST. In 1979 Baginski was a Russian language instructor during the Cold War at NSA. Later on she held many other positions in the NSA including, lead analyst for the Soviet Union, assistant deputy director of technology and systems, senior operations officer in the National Security Operations Center chief officer of the director, and executive assistant to the director of NSA’s Central Security Service, and SIGINT director.

            On September 11, 2001, Maureen Baginski was the director of SIGINT and is recognized as being very critical to NSA’s response to the terrorist attacks. She also directed the Extended SIGINT Enterprise after the 9/11 attacks. In 2003, Baginski led the FBI’s first ever intelligence program. She is known as the first head of the FBI's Directorate of Intelligence. This new program was put in place to develop the FBI’s intelligence capabilities and identify threats across the world in order to prevent them from becoming attacks. Through her time in the FBI Baginski was recognized for making very significant changes to the FBI which improved its capabilities to safeguard the country. Maureen Baginski is a very extraordinary woman and has received many awards to prove it to the world, even though her work speaks for itself. She has received the Director of Military Intelligence’s Leadership Award, NSA’s exceptional Civilian Service Award, the FBI Intelligence Analysts Association Award, two Presidential Rank awards, and two Director of Central Intelligence National Achievement Medals.

        <h2>Teachable Machines</h2>
        <p>Mary Rickman / July 19th, 2022</p>

        <p>
            On our second day of class me and a partner made a teachable machine. A teachable machine is a web tool in which you can create a machine learning model really easily and people can access it. For my teachable machine we trained the machine to be able to recognize the difference between a monarch butterfly, a sonoran blue butterfly, and a purple hairstreak butterfly. We did this by inputting data from each species into the model. The way the machine works is that a user would be able to upload a picture of one of the three butterflies and the machine would show the user what species the butterfly is. The machine does this by giving a percentage of accuracy in which it detects each species. For example if a user were to upload a picture of the monarch butterfly the machine should predict with 100% accuracy that it is a monarch butterfly. Something that I learned is that with machine learning an abundance of data is ideal because it reduces the margin of error. So in the future I would definitely add more data and more variations, such as species, into the model.

        <h2>Tech Scavanger Hunt</h2>
        <p>Mary Rickman / July 20th, 2022</p>

        <p>
            Today we did a tech scavenger hunt where we went around campus to interview different people on campus who use technology and data in their daily lives. A few people I visited were the Vice Chancellor, Provost, and Chief Academic Officer of Syracuse University, Gretchen Ritter, the Director of Undergraduate Recruitment, Adrienne Graves, and Donna Adams who works in the Department of Public Safety. One of my favorite locations was the Department of Public Safety. This is because Donna Adams ended up showing us the control center of the department and it looked like a control center right out of a high tech movie.The Department of Public Safety uses technology to monitor the school and keep it safe 24 hours a day everyday. Adams told us that at least 2 people are in the center monitoring the cameras and any incoming calls. If there is a major event on campus then at least 4 people are manning the center. The Department of Public Safety is run of technology and collects data from all the cameras on campus to access threats and emergencies in the area.

        <h2>Information About The iSchool </h2>
        <p>Mary Rickman / July 21st, 2022</p>

        <p>
            The IT Girls Summer Program is held in the School of Information Studies here at Syracuse University. So far the experience has been amazing and I'm learning something new every day. This video is very helpful on getting more information about the iSchool and what it provides for its students. <br>

        <h2>Citizen Science</h2>
        <p>Mary Rickman / July 21st, 2022</p>

        <p>
            Citizen Science is the involvement of the public in scientific research. With citizen science scientists are able to upload their projects to the world and get voluntary help from the public in order to improve their research. For example, me and my group rearched a project called Node Code Breakers. In this project researchers are trying to improve their A.I models that they used to identify germinal centers in the lymph nodes of breast cancer patients, which mean that the patient has an active immune system. An active immune system could cause a better prognosis. To do this they ask for the help of the public to look at pictures of lymph nodes and identify these germinal centers, so they can compare it to the identification produced by their A.I models. They are asking the public to do this in order to improve the A.I’s methods and further benefit cancer research. Another example is a project called Killer Whale Count, which is asking the public to count and identify killer whales in images taken at steller sea lions in the western region. This project's purpose is for scientists to better understand killer whale predation.
