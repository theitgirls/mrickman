        Hi, my name is Mary Rickman from Brockton, Massachusetts. I am a rising senior at Southeastern Voc Tech. I decided to take this class because I have for a long time had an interest in cybersecurity and I felt that a whole class with women interested in a stem field would be a great opportunity. Outside of school I enjoy watching movies and tv shows and have nighttime drives with my friends. Marvel and Horror movies are my favorite. I also really enjoy music, mostly any genre as long as I can just vibe to it.
