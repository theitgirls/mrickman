        <h1>Mary Rickman's Biography</h1>

        <p>
            Hi, my name is Mary Rickman from Brockton, Massachusetts. I am a rising senior at Southeastern Voc Tech. I decided to take this class because I have for a long time had an interest in cybersecurity and I felt that a whole class with women interested in a stem field would be a great opportunity.

        <p>
            Outside of school I enjoy watching movies and tv shows and have nighttime drives. Marvel and Horror movies are my favorite. Some of my favorite tv shows are SWAT, Criminal Minds, and All American as of right now. I also really enjoy music like can't live without it, I like mostly any genre as long as I can just vibe to it, and or just connect to the lyrics.
